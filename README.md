*This project shows how to create your own digital token in Ethereum.*

Actually, you can understand like this: 

In Ethereum, creating your own token just means deploying new contract.

When you are trying to work out how to transfer token, how to mint token, etc.

All of these operations can be satisfied by deploying a contract, which means, you just need to deploy a contract, and what this contract can do is just acting like what “Eth” does.

You can define a function called “Transfer” to make sure that your customer can transfer your token as they wish.

You can define a function called “TransferOwnership” by helping you when you want to exit this organization and find a new owner!

You can define a function named “Mint” to help you, if you think that your token’s supply amount cannot meet the require of your customer anymore.

You can also define anything you want, because what you created exactly is A Contract.

So, just do what you want to do in a contract in this creating digital token “Contract”.
